## Description
This back end social network API was created using NoSQL, where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts and create a friend list. The motivation for this project was to create a NoSQL database so that the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data without affecting it's flexibility and speed. 

## Installation
Clone the project Repository: https://github.com/renrojas/social-network-api

## Usage
To navigate this application, you will start by invoking it by using the following command: node server. 

You will then be able to use Insomnia to perform and test API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes as shown on the walkthrough video.
